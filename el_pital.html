        <h1>Experience the Cool Majesty of El Pital!</h1>
        <img src="Images/El_Pital2.jpg" alt="Panoramic view of El Pital mountains">
        <p>El Pital, located in the department of Chalatenango, is the highest point in El Salvador, soaring to an elevation of 2,730 meters (8,957 feet) above sea level. It's a stark contrast to the country's tropical beaches, offering a refreshing escape with its cool mountain air, cloud forests, and stunning panoramic views.</p>
        <p>This natural reserve is a haven for hikers and nature lovers. The trails wind through dense pine and oak forests, often shrouded in a mystical mist. Keep an eye out for diverse flora and fauna, including quetzals (if you're lucky!). The climate here is significantly cooler, sometimes even dropping to near-freezing temperatures, making it a unique microclimate in the heart of Central America.</p>
        <h3>Things to Do in El Pital:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hiking to the Summit:</strong> The main attraction is the trek to the very top, marked by a stone monument. On a clear day, you can see across large parts of El Salvador and even into neighboring Honduras.</li>
            <li><strong>Camping:</strong> Several designated areas offer opportunities for camping under the stars, a truly unforgettable experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Birdwatching:</strong> The cloud forest environment attracts a variety of bird species, making it a popular spot for ornithologists.</li>
            <li><strong>La Palma:</strong> The nearby town of La Palma is famous for its vibrant artisanal crafts and colorful murals, a great stop before or after your mountain adventure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember to dress in layers, bring warm clothing, and wear sturdy hiking boots. The weather can change rapidly in the mountains.</p>
