    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Discover-SV-Travel is led by Byron Rogel, a proud Salvadoran passionate about sharing the natural beauty, rich culture, and local secrets of El Salvador with travelers from around the world. Based in Surf City, La Libertad, we offer small-group, authentic tours designed to help visitors truly connect with our country beyond the typical tourist routes.</p>
    
    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>Our journey began with a simple belief: El Salvador has so much more to offer than what most tourists see. Byron’s love for his homeland and desire to change outdated perceptions inspired Discover-SV-Travel — a project to show the real El Salvador through nature adventures, cultural heritage, and genuine local experiences.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Us Unique</h2>
    <p>We keep our groups small and personal, focus on authentic local interactions, and handpick each destination so guests discover hidden gems — from crater lakes to colorful towns and coffee farms. Our tours aren’t just trips; they’re stories, connections, and memories you’ll take home.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To inspire travelers to discover the authentic spirit of El Salvador by offering safe, immersive, and culturally rich tours that benefit local communities and protect our natural heritage.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>To become the most trusted local tour company in El Salvador, known for exceptional service, meaningful experiences, and sustainable tourism that leaves a positive impact on our country and guests alike.</p>
