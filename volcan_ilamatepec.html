    <h1>Hiking Ilamatepec Volcano</h1>

    <img class="detail-image" src="Images/Volcan_Ilamatepec2.jpg" alt="Volcán Ilamatepec">


    <p>Ilamatepec Volcano (also known as <strong>Santa Ana Volcano</strong>) is one of the most rewarding and iconic outdoor adventures in <strong>El Salvador</strong>.</p>

    <h2>1. Spectacular Crater Lake</h2>
    <p>At the summit, you're greeted with a surreal view of the <strong>turquoise-blue crater lake</strong>. The color of the water often looks like it belongs in a fantasy world—bright and acidic, sometimes steaming. It's one of the most striking volcanic lakes in Central America.</p>

    <h2>2. Panoramic Views</h2>
    <p>From the top (2,381 meters / 7,812 feet), you can see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Coatepeque Lake</strong>, a sparkling blue crater lake in the distance</li>
      <li><strong>Izalco Volcano</strong>, which looks like a perfect cone</li>
      <li>Parts of the Pacific Ocean on a clear day — it’s a 360-degree view that leaves you speechless</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Rich Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>The trail winds through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lush cloud forests</strong></li>
      <li>Wildflowers and native shrubs</li>
      <li>Birds, butterflies, and maybe even a glimpse of a coati</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Peaceful Energy</h2>
    <p>Despite being a powerful volcano, the hike feels calm and meditative. The wind at the top, the open sky, and the quiet crater create a sense of peace and awe that many hikers describe as <strong>spiritual or healing</strong>.</p>

    <h2>5. Moderate Adventure</h2>
    <p>The trail is not too extreme but still offers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A good challenge (especially near the top where it's rocky)</li>
      <li>About 4–5 hours round trip</li>
      <li>Guided hikes for safety and education</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Epic Photography</h2>
    <p>Ilamatepec is a <strong>photographer's dream:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The blue-green crater lake</li>
      <li>Rugged lava rock formations</li>
      <li>Wide-angle views of surrounding volcanoes and valleys — sunrise or early morning hikes give the <strong>best light</strong> for pictures</li>
    </ul>
